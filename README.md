## Features

I changed the features from the wireframes as they did not work very well with the responsiveness. Also I change the name of the gallery from "My Army" to "Skål" - which is more of a postive thank you to the fans. I left out the page for the narrative or storyline "The Legend" and just added it to the information about the band.

Header

The Footer 

- Links to social media platforms that are related to the product. Must be fixed and visible at all times so that the user can easily get to it.
